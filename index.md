Hello!

I work at the intersection of&nbsp;technology, learning, and&nbsp;human development. With two decades in&nbsp;<abbr title="User Experience/User Interface">UX/UI</abbr> engineering, team leadership, and education, I&nbsp;help teams and&nbsp;individuals grow through structured collaboration, transparent processes, and trust-based communication. My&nbsp;focus is&nbsp;on&nbsp;creating environments where people and systems can thrive together&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;balancing&nbsp;clarity, accountability, and&nbsp;creativity.

## My specialisation

I specialise in&nbsp;leading teams, designing learning experiences, and supporting professional and personal transformation. My&nbsp;work connects strategy and practice: from improving team workflows and feedback culture to&nbsp;mentoring individuals and facilitating learning journeys in&nbsp;<abbr title="User Experience/User Interface">UX/UI</abbr>, digital, teamwork and soft skills.

I&nbsp;am&nbsp;motivated by&nbsp;values of safety, trust, mutual respect, freedom, and creativity: building cultures where autonomy and shared responsibility lead to&nbsp;sustainable results.

## My offerings

### Team leadership
I work with teams and organisations to&nbsp;shape effective, collaborative, and psychologically safe environments. My&nbsp;approach combines coaching-informed leadership, process design, training and mentoring.

Examples of my work:

* Strengthening collaboration between product, design, and engineering teams through regular syncs, introducing pairing to&nbsp;the workflow and transparent documentation practices.
* Supporting individual contributors in&nbsp;defining development goals and reflecting on&nbsp;progress through regular 1:1s&nbsp;and mentoring.
* Creating space for constructive feedback and learning by&nbsp;piloting peer feedback formats and team reflection sessions.
* Designing hiring and onboarding processes that make expectations explicit and promote inclusion and shared ownership.

I&nbsp;am&nbsp;open to&nbsp;leadership opportunities&nbsp;&ndash; both direct and cross-functional&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where I can contribute to&nbsp;team development, product delivery, and&nbsp;strategic collaboration.

### Individual coaching
Since September 2024, I&nbsp;run a&nbsp;private coaching practice supporting individuals through career transitions, leadership development, and communication challenges. My work is&nbsp;informed by&nbsp;<abbr title="International Coaching Federation">ICF</abbr>&nbsp;and <abbr title="European Mentoring and Coaching Council">EMCC</abbr> principles and grounded in&nbsp;presence, trust, and accountability.

Coaching is&nbsp;where I&nbsp;help people realign with what matters to&nbsp;them and act from clarity and self-awareness.

### Learning design and education
I&nbsp;design and facilitate learning journeys in <abbr title="User Experience/User Interface">UX/UI</abbr>, frontend development, digital, teamwork and soft skills. My programs combine accessibility, design systems, and collaborative methods to build both confidence and practical expertise.

I&nbsp;integrate inclusive design and accessibility into every learning experience—helping learners understand how technology and education can serve diverse human needs.
