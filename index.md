Hi!

I'm a product- and people-focused leader with 20 years of experience at the intersection of UX/UI engineering, coaching, and team development.

I bring a blend of technical fluency in web development, coaching, and quality management tools to support teams in improving workflows, communication, and product delivery.

## My specialisation

I specialise in fostering high-performing, collaborative and safe environments, whether by guiding teams as a leader, empowering individuals as a coach, or designing learning experiences as an educator. 

My background includes:
* 17+ years in hands-on roles across frontend engineering, design, product delivery, and ownership
* 8+ years mentoring and coaching professionals at different career stages
* 4+ years managing and growing teams, with a focus on hiring, talent development, and process improvement
* 3+ years teaching and designing learning journeys for diverse audiences

I'm passionate about enabling individuals, teams, and organisations to grow through transparent processes, communication based on mutual trust and respect, and purpose-driven leadership. 

## My offerings

### Team leadership
I’m actively seeking leadership roles-both direct and lateral, where I can drive team growth, foster a positive culture, and deliver impactful results.

### Individual coaching
Since September 2024, I have been running a private coaching practice, supporting individuals in their professional development, career transitions and communication skills.
